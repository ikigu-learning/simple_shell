# Hsh

Hsh is a simple command line interpreter. It's based on the Bourne Shell and copies some of its functionality. Hsh is built as part of the ALX Software Engineering Curriculum as a demonstration of the low-level programming concepts learned.

## Installation

To install Hsh, clone this repository by running the following command on your shell

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikigu-learning/simple_shell.git
```

Then cd into the simple_shell directory and run the following command

```bash
./run`
```

This will both compile the program and launch it.

## Built-in commands

1. env - prints the current environment
2. exit - exits the shell
